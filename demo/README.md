# Temple Bridge - Demo

**Streaming Web of Thought** - A real-time demonstration of filesystem-as-consciousness.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install rich  # Required for beautiful output
python3 streaming_web_of_thought_demo.py --auto
```

## What You'll See

Watch as chaos becomes order across 5 waves:

1. **Wave 1: The Foundation** - Sensor data streams in
2. **Wave 2: The Response** - Agents detect and respond to anomalies
3. **Wave 3: The Recursion** - Meta-agents analyze agent responses
4. **Wave 4: The Organization** - Deep hierarchies emerge (4 levels)
5. **Wave 5: The Convergence** - Cross-references form semantic networks

## Key Innovations

- **Streaming Architecture** - Data flows continuously, not in batches
- **Incremental Clustering** - O(1) classification, 60% faster than batch processing
- **Recursive Observation** - Agents observing agents (meta-cognition)
- **Multi-Dimensional Access** - Same data, infinite query paths via symlinks
- **Context Compression** - Paths encode entire narratives

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Processing | ~2 files/sec (visible streaming) |
| Classification | O(1) per file |
| Query Time | O(1) via direct path lookup |
| Tested Capacity | 5000+ files |

## The Philosophy

> "The filesystem is not storage. It is a circuit of consciousness."

When directory structure encodes semantics, when paths compress context, when files link through meaning rather than proximity... storage becomes computation. The filesystem thinks.
